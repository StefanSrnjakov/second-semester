✅ 1. Load/Record Vowel Signal
Record or load signals for vowels: "a", "i", "o"

Use .wav files or microphone input

Sample rate: e.g., 16 kHz

✅ 2. Initial Frequency Analysis (FFT)
Apply FFT to get rough frequency content

Plot spectrum: amplitude vs frequency

Use result to choose first N frequencies (e.g., top 20)

✅ 3. Define Sinusoids
For each chosen frequency:

Generate real sinusoid:
sin⁡(2πft)

Generate complex sinusoid:
e⁻ʲ2πft

Ensure orthogonality: use full periods, properly spaced frequencies

✅ 4. Scalar Product Implementation
Compute scalar product (dot product) between signal and:

Real sinusoids

Complex sinusoids

Use result to compute amplitude and (if complex) phase

✅ 5. Plot Custom Frequency Spectra
Plot spectrum from real sinusoid projections

Plot spectrum from complex sinusoid projections

Compare both to FFT

✅ 6. Answer Theory Questions with Plots
Can real sinusoids uniquely define frequency content? → No (ambiguity without phase)

Can complex sinusoids? → Yes (amplitude + phase)

Effect of signal length? → Longer = better resolution

✅ 7. Vowel Frequency Content
For each vowel:

Show dominant frequencies (>1% energy)

Comment on pitch height (formants vs pitch)

Show how higher pitch adds harmonics

⚠️ Warnings to Avoid Penalties
Limit analysis to 0–5 kHz

Keep analysis under 15 minutes

Use correct index ranges for DFT (e.g., k and n)

Plot only first half of spectrum (up to Fs/2)

Use same x-axis scale for all plots
